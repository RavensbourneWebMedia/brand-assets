### What's the difference between a *logotype* and a *mark*?

A **logotype** is the name of a company that is designed in a visually unique way. It may be displayed in a preexisting font that is customised to some degree. Or it may be built from geometric shapes that abstract letters for a specific effect.

A **mark** does not generally contain the name of the company â€” it more abstractly represents that company. It may or may not always sit next to the logotype.
